## Project: Generate TV Scripts

This project is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to build RNNs to generate Simpsons TV scripts based on a Simpsons script dataset from 27 seasons. The RNN will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern. The implementation is in `dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb`.
